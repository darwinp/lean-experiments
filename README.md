What is this? 
================

A common remark which came up at [Leanconf](http://www.leanconf.co.uk/) was "I know I should be doing experiments but it's really hard to design and run good experiments". 

People also said that it was hard to find examples of good experiments. 

Therefore I've created this Github repo as an easy place for the lean startup community to share examples of lean experiments. I hope that by sharing experiences we can make it easier for people to run experiments.

How to contribute
==============
Please add examples of experiments you have run to the [wiki](https://github.com/darwinp/lean-experiments/wiki).

It would be great if you can share the following details.

- The assumption being tested
- Your hypothesis
- How you tested your hypothesis
